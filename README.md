# **AI-Powered Solar-Powered Beach Cleaning Bot**

This project is an innovative approach to tackling beach pollution using advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and sustainable energy. The AI-Powered Solar-Powered Beach Cleaning Bot is a simulated autonomous robot designed in **Webots** that performs efficient beach cleaning while minimizing environmental impact.

## **Key Features**
- **Autonomous Operation**: Equipped with AI, the bot can navigate the beach, avoid obstacles, and efficiently clean littered areas without human intervention.
- **Trash Detection and Classification**: Uses computer vision algorithms to detect and classify different types of trash (e.g., plastic, metal, organic).
- **Solar-Powered**: Operates sustainably by harnessing solar energy, making it eco-friendly and cost-effective.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Integrated with sensors (e.g., LiDAR, ultrasonic) to avoid obstacles and ensure smooth navigation.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Connected to a dedicated website for live location tracking, dashcam video feed, and operational data monitoring.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Simulation**: Webots (Robot simulation software)
- **Programming Languages**: Python (primary), JavaScript (for web integration)
- **AI & Computer Vision**: TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask/Node.js for backend
- **Communication Protocols**: MQTT, WebSockets, or HTTP

## **How It Works**
1. The bot navigates a simulated beach environment in Webots, powered by AI and equipped with virtual sensors and cameras.
2. Trash detection and segregation algorithms classify and dispose of collected waste in appropriate compartments.
3. Solar energy powers the bot in the simulation, demonstrating sustainability.
4. Data from the bot, including live video feed and operational metrics, is streamed to a connected website for monitoring and control.

## **Use Case**
This project addresses the growing issue of beach pollution by providing an autonomous and sustainable solution. It can be scaled for real-world implementation to maintain cleaner beaches, protect marine life, and promote eco-friendly practices.
